Use the `include` option to load additional files to be evaluated within the current configuration context.
You can use this option to split a large configuration file into multiple smaller files.

Files required using `include` are also subject to auto-reloading, when using the [auto_reload_config](/options/auto_reload_config) option.
The path of the included file is evaluated relative to the current configuration file.

## Examples
```ruby {filename="Itsi.rb"}
include "middleware"
include "logging"
```

```ruby {filename="Itsi.rb"}
include "concurrency"
include "security"
```
