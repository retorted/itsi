The `get` middleware is simply an [endpoint](/middleware/endpoint) restricted to GET requests.
Endpoints are light-weight inline middleware that can be used to handle requests without the need for a fully fledged Rack-based application framework.

You can use endpoints and rack-apps simultaneously.
