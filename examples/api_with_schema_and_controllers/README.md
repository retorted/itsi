## Simple API With Schema and Controllers
Simple example of how you can use the following options:

* https://itsi.fyi/middleware/endpoint/
* https://itsi.fyi/middleware/controller
* https://itsi.fyi/middleware/endpoint/schemas/

to create validated JSON endpoints directly inside Itsi without a dedicated framework

See the simple_api example for a simpler, inline example.
