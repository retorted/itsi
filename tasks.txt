Polish and Release (At Lake):
-- Use route enum instead of regexp matches
-- Disable . files for static file serving (by default). Allow via option
-- CLI auto-completions
-- Special case, .html route match, also matches nil if try_html_extension == true)
-- Default error pages (Useful for proxy and SSR, consider if we can allow app to use these too?)
-- Static server command (has sane and safe defaults)
-- Offer password hash generation, and load from files for basic auth, api key, jwt.
-- Script name derived from location in hierarchy instead of a static param.
-- Max body size. Optional timeout for itsi service. Optional force kill of thread.
-- Revamp error system (look at Anyhow):
   Better internal errors (Break things on purpose and see how quickly we can detect where. Make clear when specific middleware fails)
-- Establish pattern for separate files for dsl feature, and accumulated errors. "Did you mean" function.
-- Faster/slicker default app, and static file serve page.
-- Performant Request convenience functions (body JSON, body form-encoded, file uploads)-- Performant Response convenience functions respond_json, respond_html, respond_file

-- Feature breakdown. For each feature make sure we have
--- Clean Code
--- Ultra robust config, with sane and safe defaults.
--- Complete Documentation (Readme + Blog)
--- Tests.
--- Debug Logging
--- Parameters for everything
--- No unwrap
--- Beautiful LSP and did you mean integration

Later:
- OTel
- Optimize Hash creation for Rack
- Image resizer
- First class Rackless Websockets
- Implement Simple Request timeout (non-fiber mode. Kill stuck threads. Default to nil)
- Print out warning if we can detect a location block will never be hit.
- Optimize: Avoid double encoding in compression filter if already compressed
- Built in dashboard + Stats
- Support Request timeout in Fiber scheduler mode
- Support UDP
- Support unix socket proxy
-- Hunt down sporradic bad file desc during tests
-- WASM pluggable middleware
-- proto proxy
