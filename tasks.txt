Filters:
- gRPC (Handlers).
  - Read should be non-blocking.
  - Support fall through and graceful routing
  - Support gzip and compression flag
  - Add reflection support
  - Unary JSON support
- Remove Github copies
- Support all middleware at top level (And remove top-level app requirement, and gRPC can be top level app)

Polish and Release (At Lake):
-- Server start takes Itsifile block
-- Fix tests (Take advantage of above)
-- Config Improvements (Make ultra robust, fool proof, verbose errors). Refuse to restart or reload if config is invalid. Gather all errors before bailing.
-- Fix opaque error handling in middleware.
-- Consider switch to Anyhow where appropriate (or make own errors cleaner)
-- Implement Print routes command
-- Implement match route command.
-- Offer password hash generation, and load from files for basic auth, api key, jwt.
-- Script name comes from location in hierarchy instead of params.
-- Request convenience functions (body JSON, body form-encoded)
-- Try (Again) to build rack env in Rust for perf bump
-- Nice Readme
-- New Tests for all filters
-- Revisit logging everywhere (Think long and hard about what we should and shouldn't log). Add lots of debug. Little info. Missing warnings and errors.
-- Parameterize EVERYTHING (socket params etc.)
-- No unwrap or except unless truly necessary.
-- Add notes on: PGGSSENCMODE="disable"
-- Optimize Rack hash creation

Later:
- First class websockets
- Implement Simple Request timeout (non-fiber mode. Kill stuck threads. Default to nil)
- Print out warning if we can detect a location block will never be hit.
- Optimize: Avoid double encoding in compression filter if already compressed
- Built in dashboard + Stats
- Support Request timeout in Fiber scheduler mode
- Support UDP
- Support unix socket proxy
-- Hunt down sporradic bad file desc during tests
-- WASM pluggable middleware
-- proto proxy
